File contains 2 classes - Child + StringTest
'Child' class contains:
** Constructor - default + public
** private variables - only able to be called by constructor 
** Method to print to console

'StringTest' class contains:
** Main() - new objects ('Child') created and displayed
** Private members (name and age) of 'Child' unable to be called as Main is not a member of this class

** Added a new Child using Console.ReadLine() - and it worked!

** How to convert string to doc correctly - only successful code is:
	int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
