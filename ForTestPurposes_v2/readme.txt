Attempting to add more than one class file

** 29/7 added updated Magic Year Calculator
** 30/7 added updated FizzBuzz
** 30/7 updated Magic Year Calculator - if statement changed to while loop

** 31/7:
** reminder that if statement and while loop implemented to handle incorrect keyboard input
** add methods to classes
** call class by creating an instance (instantiation) of the class
** created UserChoice method to give more client usability
** while loop creates continuous loop

3/8
** don't use while loop as it loops b/c number being sent to it - it never falls out!
** change while loop back to if statement to prevent continual looping
** error msg: 
	Program.cs(47,18): warning CS0219: The variable 'boolChoice' is assigned but its value is never used [/Users/Linda.Johnstone/Documents/fma/c-sharp/ForTestPurposes_v2/ForTestPurposes_v2.csproj]
** ?? change to using classes? - UserChoice method receives number for switch?
