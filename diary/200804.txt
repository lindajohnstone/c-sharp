What have I done today?
** created MagicYearCalculator class and moved files from Program.cs
** ensured Zoom could access microphone for meeting today
    ** is this meeting appropriate for me? Some of the aspects I do not feel that I can answer as I have not had the experience using Agile
    ** MYOB - incremental or iterative?
    ** Rest of activities relevant!!
** created FizzBuzz class - moved relevant code to it
** added to Child class
** tested all code changes work
