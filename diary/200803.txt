What Have I Done Today?
** Managed to get the code to run a second time with 'no' option.
** Exits as expected on 'yes'
** Tried unsuccessfully to run switch as separate class
** Bianca confirmed that clash with Agile workshop will be rescheduled
** Research on 'Access Modifiers'	
	** public - can be accessed from within own class and another (by creating instance - I.e. using 'new' keyword
	** private - can only be accessed within class - getters and setters need to be used for access in another class.
	** protected - only used in same assemblies - what does this mean??
