C# strongly typed language

Namespace
** can help control scope of class and method names in larger projects - a way to present program elements that are exposed to other programs
** keyword (lowercase) to declare a namespace
** used by .NET to organise its many classes
** must be a valid C# identifier name
** used within (internal organisation) a program

C# Identifiers
** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-numeric-format-strings?redirectedfrom=MSDN
** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/identifier-names
** must start with a letter or _
** Naming conventions
	** C# programs use PascalCase for type names, namespaces, and all public members. 	In addition, the following conventions are common:
		Interface names start with a capital I.
		Attribute types end with the word Attribute.
		Enum types use a singular noun for non-flags, and a plural noun for flags.
		Identifiers should not contain two consecutive _ characters. Those names are reserved for compiler generated identifiers.

Class
** reference type
** declared by using 'class' keyword
** access modifiers:	
	** public - anyone can create instances
** name of class must be a valid C# identifier name
** defines a type of object but is not an object itself

Object
** can be created by using the new keyword followed by the name of the class it is based on
	** Customer object1 = new Customer();
** don't create object references that don't refer to an object. Give object a valid name; otherwise trying to access this object will fail at run time

Method
** public: can only be accessed by objects using dot syntax (Car.MyMethod();)
** static: can be accessed w/o creating and object of the class
** public keyword == access modifier
** constructor method used to initialise objects; cannot have a return type; name must match class name

Access Modifiers
** used to control visibility of class members (security)
** sensitive data is hidden from users (encapsulation)
** public == code accessible all classes
** private == code only accessible within same class
** protected == code accessible within same class or in a class that is inherited from that class
** internal == code only accessible within own assembly, but not from another assembly
** protected internal
** private protected
** if no access modifier is specified, class members are private

Method properties
** combination of variable and method; has 2 methods: get and set
** automatic properties: e.g. 
	class Person
	{
  		public string Name  // property
  			{ get; set; }
	}

	class Program
	{
 	 	static void Main(string[] args)
  		{
    			Person myObj = new Person();
    			myObj.Name = "Liam";
    			Console.WriteLine(myObj.Name);
  		}
	}

Encapsulation
** better control of class members (reduce possibility of code being messed up)
** fields can be read-only (get method only) or write-only (set method only)
** flexible - one part of the code can be changed without affecting other parts
** increased security of data

Inheritance (Is this relevant)
** Derived class (child) - inherits from
** Base class (parent) - being inherited from
** useful for code reusability
** use of 'sealed' keyword will prevent inheritance

Polymorphism (Is this relevant)

Abstraction
** process of hiding certain details; shows only essential information to user
** abstract keyword used for classes and methods
** abstract class - a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects; must be inherited from another class to be used
** abstract method - cannily be used in an abstract class and does not have a body; body is provided by derived class (inherited)
** abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods
** https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_abstract.asp
** used to achieve security 
** also be achieved with Interfaces
